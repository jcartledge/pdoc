autoload?
syntax - interface etc
refactor parse logic

docs:

everything is a search
results are always the same:

[first match expanded]
[second match]
[...]
[final match]

flags:

    - #r/recursive
    - #f/follow-includes
(if no flags are set, objects of all types are returned)
options:
    - p/path            clon-separated list of paths to search on
    - t/pattern         applies to directories searched, not to included files
args:
    search - currently only one



FOR INCLUDES: don;t use paths
use include_path
but evaluate from parsed file
(so if they are relative - ie don't start with / - prepend dirname($filename))

forget about gui, first the static analysis

enumerate
    packages?
    functions
    vars?
    classes
        properties
        methods
    interfaces

get docblocks if they exist
for functions and methods get internal docs
for functions and methods get signature
get var and property type hint
get function and method param and return type hints


$d = new Docs;
$o = new Options;
$o->args[] = 'wp_';
$results = $d->search($o);

cache results in $TMP?

doing a naive search for func
    load the file
    grep every line and capture good bits
    store file, line num and good bits


regex for function name($args)
